The Bitmovin challenge for Interns
This project was made by Lukas Wobak
The program first checks if the file is already locally downloaded and deletes it if it is. 
It then downloads the file from the given URL and saves it in the local repo. 
While downloading it also counts the characters, which it then sorts and prints in descending order. 
There is minimal error handling for the connectivity.
